Case Study: Analysis of Instagram Impressions Data

Objective:
To analyze Instagram impressions data by exploring the distribution of impressions from various sources and visualizing these insights.

1. Data Import and Inspection:

Data Import: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv(). The file is read with 'latin1' encoding to handle special characters.
Initial Inspection: The first few rows of the dataset are printed to get an overview of the data. The .isnull().sum() method checks for missing values, and .info() provides a summary of the dataset's structure, including data types and non-null counts.
2. Distribution of Impressions:

From Home: A histogram with a kernel density estimate (KDE) is created to visualize the distribution of impressions from home. The plot uses a sleek, modern style (fivethirtyeight) to enhance readability.

From Hashtags: Another histogram is plotted to show the distribution of impressions from hashtags.

From Explore: A third histogram visualizes the distribution of impressions from the Explore page.

Each plot is sized appropriately and styled for clarity, helping to understand how impressions vary across different sources.

3. Impressions Aggregation and Visualization:

Data Aggregation: Total impressions from each source ('From Home', 'From Hashtags', 'From Explore', 'Other') are summed up.
Pie Chart: A pie chart is created to visualize the proportion of total impressions coming from each source. The chart features a hole in the center for a 'donut' style look, which emphasizes the distribution of impressions across the different sources.
Conclusion:
This analysis provides a clear view of Instagram impressions from various sources. Histograms offer insights into the distribution of impressions, while the pie chart highlights the relative importance of each source. These visualizations can help in understanding engagement patterns and optimizing Instagram strategies.
